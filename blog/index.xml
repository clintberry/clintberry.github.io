      <description>Here are some of the highlights from my 2019 reading:

Accelerate, by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim This came out in 2018, but it had a big enough impact I wanted to make sure to put it down on the this first quarterly list.</description>

      <description>In the product development department at Weave, our motto is Never Satisfied. We are constantly trying to improve how we work, including experimenting with changes to department processes and organization as a whole.
