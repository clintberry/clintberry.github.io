      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://clintberry.com/images/backbonelocked.png&#34; alt=&#34;backbonelocked&#34; title=&#34;backbonelocked&#34; width=&#34;568&#34; height=&#34;111&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-670&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my current company I am working on my first large-scale production backbone.js app and I couldn&amp;#8217;t be happier. After using backbone.js for a few months I have caught the vision and I am becoming more and more proficient. But every once and a while I still run into problems I would consider basic, but I can&amp;#8217;t seem to find much help on the interwebs. Authentication with backbone.js apps was one of those problems. So I am posting the solution I came up with in hopes it will benefit someone else, and hopefully will garner some feedback or potentially better ways to solve authentication with Backbone.js.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
